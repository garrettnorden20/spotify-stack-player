# Spotify Stack Player

When listening to music, I really like being able to dive into a certain album, and then come right back out to where I was in a playlist - kinda like stepping in and stepping out of a debugger.
That's why I made this alternative player (to be controlled by my macropad), so I can easily get in and get out.

Unfortunately, Spotify API sucks, so I can't dive back out to the Spotify DJ (which is the only playlist I use cause I hate making playlists). But the DJ isn't great anyway, so I decided this 
will also just queue up random songs from my top most played so I don't have to use DJ.

TODO: 
- Pause functionality is fragile garbage
- Add the adafruit files
- add script to run this thing on startup
